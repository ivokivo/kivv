        <p> I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and say thank you for everything altough our relationship didn't work out as we had hoped. I really wanted to to make things better between us, but it's not what you want. I never want to give up on you, but I know you have given up on me. I know it's time for me to say goodbye. You don't have to worry about me anymore. You can focus on your new story without me and be genuinely hapy. I know that we ended everything about us pero sabi nga nila love has a habbit of coming back, but it should not be forced. I'm always here, So if you wanna try again you can always come back to me and make things right this time. And if everyone fails to understand you, always remember that I would. Just reach out, and take a few step towards my path and I would be there for you, ready to listen. Always take care, I'm always rooting for you. Padayon. 
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          I hope you find the love, the love that feels just right, the kind of love you truly deserve. I hope ypu find that person who will give you the love that cones with peace. Take this time to heal anf become a better version of yourself. I whish nothing but your hapiness. 
        </p>
